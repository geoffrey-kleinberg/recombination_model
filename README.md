# Comparison of EM Algorithm to Hierarchical Estimator

### EM Algorithm

The EM Algorithm is an iterative method to calculate the MLE
of observed data when there is a latent variable. This
algorithm is implemented in Python in emAlgorithm.py

### Hierarchical Estimator

The Hierarchical Estimator uses Markov Chain Composite
Likelihood (MCCL) to approximate the MLE by assuming the
observed data follow a Markov Chain. This algorithm is
implemented in R. See DOCUMENTATION.txt for details.
